                                                     Voice Classification using ML
What is Voice Classification..?
Voice Classification is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech/Voice. 
This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. 
This is also the phenomenon that animals like dogs and horses employ to be able to understand human emotion.

We can run this project on Kaggle platform.
We can give our dataset path to datapath, since the 4 Datasets are too large we used to make this project on kaggle platform & it also gives us GPU suport.
